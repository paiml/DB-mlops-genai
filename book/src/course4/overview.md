# Course 4: GenAI Engineering on Databricks

## Subtitle
Build LLM Applications with Foundation Models, Vector Search, and RAG

## Description
Construct production GenAI systems on Databricks: serve foundation models, implement vector search for semantic retrieval, build RAG pipelines, and fine-tune models for domain adaptation. Understand the internals by building equivalent systems with the Sovereign AI Stack.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Serve and query foundation models on Databricks
2. Generate embeddings and build vector search indexes
3. Implement production RAG pipelines with hybrid retrieval
4. Fine-tune models with LoRA/QLoRA for domain adaptation
5. Deploy privacy-aware GenAI systems with proper governance

## Duration
~34 hours | 40 videos | 12 labs | 5 quizzes | 1 capstone
